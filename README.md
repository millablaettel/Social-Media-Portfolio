# Students application
Basic web application for demonstrating core client/server architecture concepts as well as the main technologies involved. This website also includes information about myself, as well as my Curriculum Vitae.

## Project structure
The Navigation Bar of my website includes 4 buttons. 
Home Button: Use the üè° or the 'Home' Button to get to the main page.
This page includes a link to every Class we had in the wintersemester of 2023/2024. Every link brings you to a informational page about the subjects that were learned.

My Curriculum: This button brings you to my Curriculum Vitae. I used JavaScript to make it interactive! Click on each of the different button to have the information revealed.

My Class: This button brings you to my schedule of the winter semester.

Portfolio: This button brings you to a few selected artworks from me.
