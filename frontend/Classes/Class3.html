    <div class="infobox">
        <h2>What is Frontend Development?</h2>
        <p>Frontend development, often simply referred to as "front-end," is a discipline in web and software
            development
            that focuses on creating the <strong>user interface and user experience (UI/UX)</strong> of a website or
            application. The
            primary
            goal of frontend development is to ensure that the application or website is <strong>visually appealing,
                responsive,
                and
                user-friendly.</strong> Frontend developers work on the client side of web development, which means they
            deal with
            what
            users see and interact with in their browsers or on their devices.
        </p>
        <h2>Good UX/UI</h2>
        <p>Good User Interface (UI) refers to the visual and interactive aspects of a product, whether it's a
            website, application, or any other software. A UI is considered good when it effectively presents
            information and functionality to the user in an <strong>aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly
                manner.</strong>
            <br>
            User Experience encompasses the broader, holistic experience a user has with a product, including their
            <strong>emotional and practical interactions.</strong> A good user experience focuses on making the entire
            interaction as
            positive and efficient as possible. It includes the UI but extends beyond it.

    <h2>Key Technologies in Web Development</h2>
    Web pages are composed by:
    <ul>
        <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content</li>
        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout</li>
        <li>JavaScript for adding interactivity</li>
    </ul>
