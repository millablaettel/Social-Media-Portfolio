    <h1>Data Storage and Databases</h1>
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Data storage refers to the <strong>physical or digital means of preserving and retaining data </strong> for
        future use. It is the
        broader concept that encompasses <strong>various methods and technologies </strong>for storing data.
        <br>Data storage can include a wide range of storage technologies, such as <strong>hard disk drives (HDDs),
            solid-state
            drives (SSDs), cloud storage, tape storage, optical storage, and more. </strong>
        <br> Here are some examples: <br>

    <h2>Database</h2>
    <p>It is a structured collection of data organized for <strong>efficient storage, retrieval, and management.
        </strong>
        It is designed to support the efficient querying and processing of data, enforcing relationships between
        different pieces of information.

    <h4>Relational Databases</h4>
    <p>Relational databases are a type of database that organizes data into tables, <strong>using a relational
            model.</strong> <br>Key
        components of relational databases include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tables:</strong> Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.</li>
        <li><strong>Rows:</strong> Each row represents a specific record or data entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Columns:</strong> Columns define attributes or properties of the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Keys:</strong> Unique identifiers for each record.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Tables are related through keys, creating associations between records.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Structured Query Language is used for querying and manipulating data.</li>
        <li><strong>ACID Properties:</strong> Ensures reliable transactions and data integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
        <li>Oracle Database</li>
        <li>SQLite</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Relational databases are widely used in various applications, such as <strong>business systems, e-commerce
            platforms, and
            content management systems</strong>, due to their ability to efficiently handle structured data and support
        complex
        relationships.</p>
