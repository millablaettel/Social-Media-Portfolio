    <h2>Server, Hosting and Development </h2>
    <p>A server is a computer or software application that <strong>provides services or resources</strong> to other
        computers, known as
        clients, within a network. <br> <br>
        Hosting refers to the service of <strong>providing the infrastructure, resources, and environment</strong> for a
        website,
        application, or service to be accessible on the internet. Web hosting companies offer server space and
        support
        for individuals or organizations to store their website files, databases, and other assets.
        <br><br> Deployment is the process of making a software application or system <strong>available for
            use.</strong>
