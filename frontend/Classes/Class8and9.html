    <h2>Command Line Interface - CLI and Application Debugging</h2>
    <p>A command-line application, also known as a console application or command-line interface (CLI) program, is a
        software application designed to be operated <strong>primarily through a text-based command-line interface in a
            terminal
            or command prompt.</strong> </p>
    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>In the context of software development, dependencies refer to <strong>external modules, libraries, or packages
            that a
            software project relies on to function correctly.</strong> These dependencies are typically third-party code
        or pre-built
        components that provide specific functionalities or services. They are used to <strong>enhance the capabilities
            of a
            project, avoid reinventing the wheel, and promote code reuse across different applications.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Application Port</h2>
    <p>A port is a communication endpoint that is used by protocols to <strong>identify a specific process or service
        </strong> on a
        device.

    <h2>Application Debugging</h2>
    <p>Debugging is the process of <strong>identifying, isolating, and fixing errors or bugs </strong> in a computer
        program. A <i>bug </i> is a
        flaw or unintended behavior in the code that prevents it from executing as intended. <br> <br>
